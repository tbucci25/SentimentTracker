You said:
is there anything I would be able to code to help with primary industry research?
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely—there are several tools you could build to streamline and scale aspects of your primary industry research workflow, especially if you do a lot of expert calls, data synthesis, or competitive tracking. Here are some ideas, grouped by function:

🗂 Call Management & Analysis
1. Transcript Summarizer & Highlighter

What it does: Automatically ingests Zoom/Teams transcripts and highlights key themes (e.g., demand trends, pricing, competition).

How to build: Use OpenAI or another LLM API + basic keyword tagging and entity recognition.

2. Smart Tagging System for Expert Calls

What it does: Assigns structured tags (e.g., "Volume trends: improving", "Inventory: elevated") to call notes.

How to build: Fine-tune a classification model or use LLMs with prompt engineering to extract standardized outputs.

3. Voice-to-Structured Notes Pipeline

What it does: Takes your call audio → transcribes it → auto-structures it into bullet-point notes under headers.

How to build: Combine Whisper (for transcription) with GPT prompts for formatting.

🔍 Industry Scanning & Monitoring
4. Competitor Intelligence Tracker

What it does: Scrapes press releases, 10-Ks, and earnings transcripts for specific companies and flags key mentions (e.g., new launches, pricing changes).

How to build: Web scraping + NLP summarization or even GPT with a recurring web pipeline.

5. Smart News Aggregator

What it does: Collects and summarizes relevant news articles by sector or company, scoring them by importance.

How to build: RSS feed parser or news API + relevance classifier or GPT summarizer.

6. Regulatory/Event Tracker

What it does: Tracks FDA decisions, CMS updates, court cases, or regulatory events for a target list of companies or products.

How to build: Scrape or API-pull from key agencies and filter for topics of interest.

📊 Competitive & Financial Analysis
7. Financial Comparison Dashboard

What it does: Visualizes key metrics (rev growth, margins, opex) across peers with YoY and QoQ toggles.

How to build: Pull data from APIs (e.g., Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance) and plot with a front-end in Streamlit or Dash.

8. Call Aggregator & Search Engine

What it does: Lets you keyword search across all your past expert calls and groups mentions by company/topic.

How to build: Use a vector store (e.g., FAISS) with embeddings + a lightweight front-end.

🤖 Workflow Efficiency
9. Note Template Generator

What it does: Auto-generates a note skeleton (summary + sub-bullets) based on a rough transcript or messy notes.

How to build: Feed your notes/transcripts into GPT with a custom prompt that mirrors your usual note format.

10. CRM for Primary Research

What it does: Lets you log who you've spoken with, what company they're from, and when the last convo was.

How to build: Basic SQL or Airtable + web UI.

If you want, I can help prioritize based on your current workflow or even build a quick prototype with you. Curious—what part of your process feels most manual or painful today?

You said:
it would be great to develop a sentiment tracker by industry or sector with the inputs being either notes or a transcript
ChatGPT said:
That's a great and very actionable idea—an Industry Sentiment Tracker built from transcripts or notes would directly help you quantify tone over time and across multiple expert inputs. Here's how you could approach building it, step by step:

🧠 Concept: Industry Sentiment Tracker
Goal:
Turn qualitative expert commentary (from transcripts or notes) into quantitative, directional insights on sentiment—by industry, sector, or theme (e.g., pricing, volume, margin).

🧰 Tool Architecture
1. Inputs
Raw text from expert call notes or transcripts (could be messy, partial, etc.)

Optional tags: company, industry, date

2. Preprocessing
Clean the text (e.g., remove filler words, timestamps)

Optionally chunk into logical sections (e.g., per topic or paragraph)

3. Sentiment + Topic Classification
Use an LLM (e.g., GPT-4 or Claude) to extract:

Overall sentiment: positive / neutral / negative

Topic-specific sentiment: e.g., for "demand", "pricing", "margins", "inventory"

Supporting quote: short phrase as evidence

Confidence score: optional

Prompt example: “Read the following expert transcript. For each topic (demand, pricing, inventory), classify the sentiment as Positive, Neutral, or Negative and provide a supporting quote.”

4. Output Storage
Store structured results in a table or lightweight database:

industry, company, date, topic, sentiment, quote

5. Visualization Dashboard
Built in Streamlit, Plotly Dash, or Shiny

Filters:

Time range

Sector or company

Topic

Charts:

Sentiment trend over time

Topic heatmaps by company

Top positive/negative quotes

🧪 Example Output

Industry	Company	Date	Topic	Sentiment	Supporting Quote
Staffing	Firm A	2025-04-01	Demand	Negative	“Volume is down about 20% YoY in March.”
Staffing	Firm A	2025-04-01	Pricing	Neutral	“Rates have stabilized since February.”
Trucking	Firm B	2025-03-20	Margins	Positive	“We're seeing cost relief across the board.”
💡 Bonus Features
Trend alerts (e.g., sudden shift in sentiment for pricing in a sector)

PDF/Word doc input parser for manual notes

Slack/email integration for weekly sentiment updates

If you're interested, I can help you:

Design a prototype

Build a working GPT prompt chain

Set up a minimal dashboard (Streamlit is great for this)

Would you want to try this on a few real transcripts or notes you've already got? We could spin up a demo together.

You said:
yes that would be great
ChatGPT said:
Awesome! Let’s kick this off. Here's a quick roadmap, and then I’ll ask for a sample input to start building the prototype.

🔧 Step-by-Step Plan to Build Your Sentiment Tracker Prototype
✅ Step 1: Get Sample Input
Please upload:

One or more call transcripts or expert notes (can be in plain text, .docx, or .pdf).

Ideally include the industry/sector and date for each.

✅ Step 2: Define Topics You Want to Track
Examples (feel free to edit or expand):

Demand

Pricing

Margins

Inventory

Competition

Hiring / Labor

Macro headwinds

Let me know which of these—or others—you want the tracker to focus on.

✅ Step 3: Build the Sentiment Extraction Prompt
I’ll use GPT to:

Parse the document

Identify relevant topics

Assign sentiment (Positive / Neutral / Negative)

Extract a short supporting quote

✅ Step 4: Visual Output
We’ll start by displaying the extracted info as a table. Once that works, we can push it into a Streamlit dashboard if you want interactivity.

Once you upload a file and confirm your topic list, I’ll start coding the pipeline and show you the output. Ready when you are!

You said:
Concrete Insights_ Q1’25 Recap - Takeaways.docx
Document
Concrete Insights_ Q4’24 & 2025 Outlook - Takeaways.docx
Document
Topics to track: demand, volume, pricing, macro headwinds/tailwinds
ChatGPT said:
Great — I’ve reviewed both documents and am ready to run the sentiment extraction process. Here's a quick look at what I’ll extract from each document:

🎯 Topics You’re Tracking:
Demand

Volume

Pricing

Macro headwinds/tailwinds

🧪 Next Step: Run Sentiment Analysis
For each of the two docs, I’ll extract:

Topic

Sentiment (Positive / Neutral / Negative)

Supporting Quote

Industry (Concrete / Construction)

Date (from document heading)

Give me a moment while I generate that now.

I've successfully parsed both documents and extracted their dates:

Q1'25 Recap → April 14, 2025

Q4'24 & 2025 Outlook → February 4, 2025

Each text has been cleaned and is ready for topic-based sentiment extraction. Now I’ll run the sentiment analysis on the topics you care about:

Demand

Volume

Pricing

Macro headwinds/tailwinds

Give me a moment while I process that using an LLM. ​​

Here’s a structured sentiment summary for the concrete industry across both expert notes, broken down by topic and source:

🧱 Concrete Industry Sentiment Tracker

Topic	Date	Sentiment	Supporting Quote	Source
Demand	2025-04-14	Positive	“Strong backlog built in late 2024 and early 2025 underpinned growth...”	Q1’25 Recap
Demand	2025-02-04	Positive	“Large-scale industrial projects... have accelerated and are the main drivers…”	Q4’24 & 2025 Outlook
Volume	2025-04-14	Positive	“Ready-mix volume growth exceeded expectations by MSD%, up ~10% YoY…”	Q1’25 Recap
Volume	2025-02-04	Positive	“Ready-mix concrete volumes up 10% and full-year volume 10%-15% higher y/y.”	Q4’24 & 2025 Outlook
Pricing	2025-04-14	Slightly Positive	“Pricing is up around $5 per cubic yard YoY at the lower end but stable at the higher end.”	Q1’25 Recap
Pricing	2025-02-04	Slightly Positive	“2025 could see more noticeable price hikes of $5-$10 per cubic yard...”	Q4’24 & 2025 Outlook
Macro Headwinds	2025-04-14	Mixed	“Tariffs are the primary near-term risk... Labor workforce expansion is the next biggest headwind.”	Q1’25 Recap
Macro Headwinds	2025-02-04	Mixed	“Labor remains the primary headwind... interest rates will delay residential recovery.”	Q4’24 & 2025 Outlook
🧭 Takeaways:
Demand and volume sentiment are both strongly positive across periods, driven by infrastructure, chip plants, and industrial activity.

Pricing is trending slightly positive—modest increases expected, especially in high-demand markets.

Macro sentiment is mixed: bullish on project momentum, but cautious on labor shortages, tariffs, and interest rate overhangs.

Next, I can:

Push this to a Streamlit dashboard for filtering and charting

Add more sectors or quarters if you have more files

Output this as a CSV or Excel file

Want to build the dashboard next?

You said:
yes, thanks!
ChatGPT said:
Your Industry Sentiment Tracker dashboard is now set up in Streamlit code format 🎉

It includes:

Filters by topic and date

Sentiment table

Bar chart showing sentiment distribution by topic

Supporting quotes for context

You can run it locally by saving the code as sentiment_tracker.py and launching via:

streamlit run sentiment_tracker.py
Would you like help deploying it online (e.g., Streamlit Cloud), or integrating more files or sectors?

You said:
where am I able to deploy this type of code online?
ChatGPT said:
Great question! Here are some of the best places to deploy your Streamlit sentiment tracker app online — all of these work well with minimal setup:

🚀 1. Streamlit Community Cloud (Free & Easiest)

You said:
how do you push them via github client
ChatGPT said:
Great question! Here's how to push files using the GitHub CLI (or any local Git client) — this assumes you have the repo cloned locally or are working inside a GitHub Codespace or terminal:

🧭 Steps to Push Files via Git (Local or Codespace)
✅ 1. Move the files into your repo folder
Download these first:

sentiment_tracker.py

requirements.txt

Then move them into your local repo folder or drop them into your Codespace directory.

🧼 2. Check the Git status
In terminal (or Codespace):

git status
You should see the two new files listed as "untracked".

➕ 3. Add the files to staging
git add sentiment_tracker.py requirements.txt
📝 4. Commit the changes
git commit -m "Add Streamlit sentiment tracker and requirements"
🚀 5. Push to GitHub
git push
If your branch is main or master, this pushes directly. If you're on a feature branch, you can either:

Push and merge via GitHub.com UI

Or create a pull request (gh pr create if you use GitHub CLI)

Once the files are pushed, go back to Streamlit Cloud, connect your repo, and follow the deployment steps.

Want me to help you automate future updates or connect this to a database later?

You said:
it can't find my github repository
ChatGPT said:
Got it — if Streamlit Cloud can't find your GitHub repository, here’s how to troubleshoot and fix it step by step:

🛠 Step-by-Step: Fix “Can’t Find Repo” on Streamlit Cloud
✅ 1. Check if the Repo is Public
Streamlit Cloud by default only shows public repos unless you’ve upgraded your account and granted private repo access.

Fix: Go to your repo → click “Settings” → scroll to “Danger Zone” → and make it Public

You can make it private again after deploying if needed (though the app will break unless you stay on a paid Streamlit plan).

🔑 2. Check GitHub App Permissions for Streamlit
Go to Streamlit Cloud → Settings → Account

Under “GitHub repository access”, click Manage

Make sure the GitHub repo is either:

Included in "All repositories" access OR

Explicitly selected under "Only select repositories"

If your repo is not listed, it's likely you didn't authorize Streamlit to see it.

📁 3. Confirm Repo Has the Required Files
In your GitHub repo, make sure it contains:

sentiment_tracker.py

requirements.txt

And that these are in the root folder (not nested in subdirectories).

🧹 4. Clear Streamlit Cache (if it’s being weird)
Sometimes refreshing the page or logging out/back into Streamlit Cloud resolves the issue.

🆘 Still stuck?
If none of that works, tell me:

Repo name (e.g., your-username/sentiment-tracker)

Whether it’s public or private

Whether you see it on GitHub.com normally

And I’ll walk you through the next move!

    raise TypeError(f"Invalid comparison between dtype={left.dtype} and {typ}")
ChatGPT said:
Thanks for sharing the error — it's a common issue that occurs when the date input from Streamlit doesn’t match the format expected by Pandas.

🧠 What’s Causing It?
The error is caused because st.date_input() can return a single date (as a datetime.date) or a tuple (start, end) depending on how the user interacts with the widget.

Your code assumes it's always a tuple, so if a single date is returned, trying to index it (date_range[0]) crashes.

✅ Quick Fix
Wrap the date input with a check to ensure it always returns a tuple of two dates.

Replace this line in your code:

date_range = st.date_input("Select date range:", [sentiment_data['Date'].min(), sentiment_data['Date'].max()])
With this safer version:

date_range = st.date_input("Select date range:", [sentiment_data['Date'].min().date(), sentiment_data['Date'].max().date()])

# Ensure it's always treated as a date range (tuple of 2)
if isinstance(date_range, tuple) and len(date_range) == 2:
    start_date, end_date = date_range
else:
    start_date = end_date = date_range
Then update the filtering logic:

filtered_data = sentiment_data[
    sentiment_data['Topic'].isin(topic_filter) &
    sentiment_data['Date'].dt.date.between(start_date, end_date)
]
This handles both single-date and date-range scenarios safely.

Let me know if you'd like me to regenerate the full corrected sentiment_tracker.py for you to download.

You said:
where do I update more transcripts and files
ChatGPT said:
Great question — there are two main ways you can update your sentiment tracker with new transcripts or files, depending on how you want to scale it:

🛠 Option 1: Manually Add More Data to sentiment_tracker.py
📍 Where:
Inside the script, look for the hardcoded DataFrame:

sentiment_data = pd.DataFrame([
    {"Topic": "Demand", "Date": "2025-04-14", ...},
    ...
])
🔁 How to Add:
Just append more entries in the same format:

{"Topic": "Volume", "Date": "2025-05-10", "Sentiment": "Positive", "Quote": "...", "Source": "Q2'25 Update"},
This works fine for small numbers of updates and is very fast to test.

📂 Option 2: Enable File Uploads in the App (Streamlit-native)
Let users (or you) upload .docx or .txt files of transcripts right into the app. You’d then parse the file, run sentiment detection, and update the dashboard dynamically.

Example UI:
uploaded_file = st.file_uploader("Upload a transcript", type=["docx", "txt"])
if uploaded_file:
    raw_text = uploaded_file.read().decode("utf-8") if uploaded_file.name.endswith("txt") else docx2txt.process(uploaded_file)
    # Run your GPT analysis here on raw_text
I can help implement this for you and even run the GPT prompt live in the backend if you'd like.

🔮 Bonus Option: External File (e.g., Google Sheets or CSV)
Use a .csv or Google Sheet that your app reads on startup. You can then update the sheet without touching code.

Let me know which approach you'd prefer next:

Keep it manual (just show me where to add lines)?

Add file upload capability?

Load from a CSV or shared sheet?

Happy to set any of those up.

You said:
load from a shared google sheet
ChatGPT said:
Awesome — loading your sentiment data from a shared Google Sheet is a scalable, collaborative approach. Here’s exactly how to set that up in your Streamlit app.

✅ Step-by-Step: Load from Google Sheets in Streamlit
📌 1. Create a Google Sheet
Make sure it includes these columns (same as your current DataFrame):

Topic | Date | Sentiment | Quote | Source
Example: Here’s a public template you can copy

Click File > Make a copy into your own Google Drive

Click Share > Anyone with the link and make it Viewer (for public use)

🔑 2. Get the Sheet ID
From the URL:

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gUl2FIRhnYBFwQ-XY9EPnYjj7fFjSgfSYOwhUz8QgJ4/edit#gid=0
Extract just this part:

1gUl2FIRhnYBFwQ-XY9EPnYjj7fFjSgfSYOwhUz8QgJ4
🧱 3. Update Your Streamlit App to Load It
Install the required lib:

pip install gspread pandas gspread_dataframe
Then update your code:

import pandas as pd
import streamlit as st
import plotly.express as px
import gspread
from gspread_dataframe import get_as_dataframe

# Connect to public Google Sheet (read-only)
sheet_id = "your_sheet_id_here"
gc = gspread.service_account(filename='credentials.json')  # Optional: needed for private sheets
sh = gc.open_by_key(sheet_id)
worksheet = sh.get_worksheet(0)  # or by name: sh.worksheet("Sheet1")

sentiment_data = get_as_dataframe(worksheet)
sentiment_data = sentiment_data.dropna(how="all")  # Drop empty rows
sentiment_data["Date"] = pd.to_datetime(sentiment_data["Date"])

# ... (rest of your Streamlit app remains unchanged)
🔐 For Private Sheets
You’ll need a Google service account and a credentials.json file — I can help set that up too if you're going private.

Would you like me to regenerate the full sentiment_tracker.py with the Google Sheets integration? If yes, just send me the Sheet ID or URL!

You said:
how do i add more sectors and files
ChatGPT said:
Great — here’s how to scale your sentiment tracker to multiple sectors and files, while still keeping it clean and manageable.

🧭 Goal
Add more:

Sectors (e.g., Staffing, Trucking, Dental, Construction)

Files (e.g., new transcripts for each sector or time period)

✅ Recommended Structure
1. Add a Sector column
Update your data format to this:


Sector	Topic	Date	Sentiment	Quote	Source
Concrete	Demand	2025-04-14	Positive	"Strong backlog built..."	Q1'25 Recap
Trucking	Pricing	2025-03-01	Neutral	"Rates have flattened after a sharp drop."	Q1 Trucking Call
➡️ This will let you filter by sector in the dashboard.

2. Maintain One Google Sheet (Optional: One Tab per Sector)
You can:

Use a single tab with a Sector column (preferred if you're comfortable sorting/filtering)

Or use multiple tabs, one for each sector (and merge them in your code)

3. Update the Dashboard Filters
Add a sector dropdown:

sector_filter = st.multiselect("Select sector(s):", sentiment_data['Sector'].unique(), default=sentiment_data['Sector'].unique())

filtered_data = sentiment_data[
    sentiment_data['Sector'].isin(sector_filter) &
    sentiment_data['Topic'].isin(topic_filter) &
    sentiment_data['Date'].dt.date.between(start_date, end_date)
]
4. Automate Processing from New Files (Optional)
If you're still extracting sentiment from raw .docx notes:

Add a script (or UI upload) that processes new files

Append the extracted results to your Google Sheet (via gspread or Zapier)

✨ Want Me to Help Update the Code?
If you’re ready:

Send me a few examples of other files/sectors (e.g., Staffing, Trucking notes)

Or a link to your current Google Sheet if you're using one

Then I can:

Regenerate sentiment_tracker.py with multi-sector support

Show you how to manage file uploads or Google Sheet ingestion

Would you like to proceed that way?

You said:
can you update the code to incorporate more sectors and with the inclusion to add processing from new .docx notes?
ChatGPT said:
✅ The sentiment tracker has been upgraded to:

Support multiple sectors (new Sector column and filter)

Allow .docx transcript uploads and dynamic processing into sentiment entries

Maintain the same user-friendly dashboard with filtering, charts, and quotes

📦 It’s still using a placeholder sentiment extraction function. You can later plug in a real GPT call, local model, or tagging rules.

Would you like me to:

Add GPT-4 or Claude-based sentiment extraction?

Integrate with a Google Sheet as a persistent backend?

Help you test the upload feature now?

Let me know where you'd like to take it next!

You said:
can the sentiment breakdown chart not have counts, but rather just an overall color from being very positive (green) to very negative (red)
ChatGPT said:
✅ Done! The Sentiment Breakdown chart is now a heatmap that reflects average sentiment on a color gradient:

🟥 Very Negative → 🟧 Negative → ⚪ Neutral → 🟩 Positive → 🟢 Very Positive

This gives you a quick visual sense of tone by topic and sector, not just counts.

Let me know if you’d like to:

Add more granular sentiment levels (e.g., 7-point scale)

Include standard deviation or confidence bands

Customize the color scheme or sorting

Or if you’re ready to connect it to GPT for live sentiment parsing, I can wire that up too!

You said:
i got a traceback error: File "/mount/src/sentimenttracker/sentiment_tracker.py", line 5, in <module>
    import docx2txt
ChatGPT said:
That error means the Python package docx2txt isn’t installed in your Streamlit environment.

✅ How to Fix It
Add docx2txt to your requirements.txt file so Streamlit Cloud or your local environment knows to install it.

✏️ Update your requirements.txt:
Just add this line:

docx2txt
Your updated requirements.txt should now include:

streamlit
pandas
plotly
docx2txt
🧪 Then redeploy:
Commit the updated requirements.txt to your GitHub repo.

If using Streamlit Cloud, it will auto-detect the update and reinstall dependencies.

If local, run:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Would you like me to regenerate the updated requirements.txt so you can download it directly?

You said:
i'd like to change the source from transcripts and docx files to one single google sheet, with the columns such as date (to be grouped by calendar quarter), sector, and sentiment which as the following drop-down (Bearish, inflection to bearish, neutral, inflection to bullish, bullish)
ChatGPT said:
Your app is now configured to:

✅ Pull data from a single Google Sheet
✅ Group sentiment by calendar quarter
✅ Use a dropdown-style sentiment scale:
Bearish, Inflection to Bearish, Neutral, Inflection to Bullish, Bullish

🔧 What to Do Next
Create your Google Sheet

Columns: Date, Sector, Sentiment, (optional) Notes

Share it publicly (or let me help set up credentials for private)

Paste your actual Google Sheet ID into this line:

SHEET_ID = "your_google_sheet_id_here"
If you send the Sheet URL, I’ll plug it in and regenerate everything for you. Want to do that now?

the sheet also has a 'call' column, but that can be ignored for the code purposes. here's the link to the sheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UAhHj6wG9_Clc7obd4jOekUohK7ifV4NYETSqdqiWSY/edit?gid=1004473607#gid=1004473607

✅ Your app now pulls live data from the shared Google Sheet at:

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UAhHj6wG9_Clc7obd4jOekUohK7ifV4NYETSqdqiWSY

It uses the 'Date', 'Sector', and 'Sentiment' columns

Ignores the 'Call' column

Automatically groups sentiment by calendar quarter

Let me know if you'd like:

A dropdown to filter by sentiment type (e.g., just show "Inflection to Bullish")

To add line charts or export buttons

Private access using Google credentials

Great! Since you’re ready to continue, here are a few upgrade ideas based on your current dashboard. Let me know which one you'd like to do next, or suggest your own:

🚀 Enhancement Options
1. 🔎 Add Filter by Sentiment Type
Let users filter for just "Bullish", "Inflection to Bearish", etc.

2. 📈 Add Trend Line or Bar Chart
Visualize sentiment scores over time by quarter (not just heatmap averages).

3. 📤 Export to CSV Button
Let users download the currently filtered table.

4. 📊 Add Count of Mentions by Sector/Quarter
Show how many entries are driving each sentiment score (context for the heatmap).

5. 🔐 Use Google Service Account to Access Private Sheets
If you want to secure your sheet instead of making it public.

Want to implement one of these? Just say the number or suggest a new one — I can instantly apply the update to your live code in canvas.
